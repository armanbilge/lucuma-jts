/**
 * An interface for rules which determine whether node points which are in boundaries of {link
 * Lineal} geometry components are in the boundary of the parent geometry collection. The SFS
 * specifies a single kind of boundary node rule, the {link Mod2BoundaryNodeRule} rule. However,
 * other kinds of Boundary Node Rules are appropriate in specific situations (for instance, linear
 * network topology usually follows the {link EndPointBoundaryNodeRule}.) Some JTS operations (such
 * as {link RelateOp}, {link BoundaryOp} and {link IsSimpleOp}) allow the BoundaryNodeRule to be
 * specified, and respect the supplied rule when computing the results of the operation. <p> An
 * example use case for a non-SFS-standard Boundary Node Rule is that of checking that a set of
 * {link LineString}s have valid linear network topology, when turn-arounds are represented as
 * closed rings. In this situation, the entry road to the turn-around is only valid when it touches
 * the turn-around ring at the single (common) endpoint. This is equivalent to requiring the set of
 * <tt>LineString</tt>s to be <b>simple</b> under the {link EndPointBoundaryNodeRule}. The
 * SFS-standard {link Mod2BoundaryNodeRule} is not sufficient to perform this test, since it states
 * that closed rings have <b>no</b> boundary points. <p> This interface and its subclasses follow
 * the <tt>Strategy</tt> design pattern.
